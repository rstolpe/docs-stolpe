# Update VMWare ESXi  
VMware vSphere 8.0 U2b is released and if your running it with just one host you can't upgrade it through vSphere. But you can do it with SSH or CLI and I'll walk you trough it.
  
We need to download the latest VMWare ESXi offline bundle file, and you can do it from [here](https://customerconnect.vmware.com/downloads/details?downloadGroup=ESXI80U2B&productId=1345).
